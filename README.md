# Abstract
Printed circuit board (PCB) defect detection faces challenges due to complex industrial environments and the difficulty in detecting minute defects. This study introduces the DCAM-RTDETR framework, which integrates hierarchical feature fusion and dynamic multi-scale attention to enhance defect detection accuracy. The framework employs a Cascaded Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion (CAMF) module for progressive feature refinement and spatial saliency-guided dynamic weighting, focusing on critical defect regions. Additionally, a Dynamic Hybrid-Scale Attention Collaborative Network (DHACN) combines local multi-core attention with global multi-scale convolution to efficiently detect micro-defects. Experimental results on the DeepPCB and PCB-DATASET datasets demonstrate superior performance, with mAP50/mAP50-95 reaching 99%/81.6% and 95.6%/50.4%, respectively, outperforming existing methods. This research provides a novel technical solution for high-precision visual inspection, significantly enhancing defect detection accuracy in complex industrial scenarios.
